# GooTrans
Developed in September 2019. Uploaded in September 2023.

### Description
GooTrans is a small Windows Form software that allows users to type in a number, resulting in the Vietnamese/English written form of that number. The result can be transferred to speech and be spoken out loud.
This was built for a class project in 2019.

### Get started
Start the software via /bin/Release/GooTrans.exe. 
Press the "?" button to read the instructions.

### Note
The program works well. However, as the project file is old, there may be a need to relocate the source code before further building.
